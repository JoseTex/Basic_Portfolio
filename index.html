                    <p>Here we're limited by the time we have. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. You can get away with a lot. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.</p>

                    <p>Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck.</p>
